The aim of the first sections in this chapter is to limit the pre-existing knowledge needed for the book.

    "For when $n=3$ it is easy to think of such a Cartesian product as a point in $3$d space, or for $n=4$ a point in $4$d space. This can exactly be the case when for example $X_1 = \\dotsb = X_n = \\rm I\\!R$ (The set of all real numbers). However, when $n$ becomes bigger than 5 it is quite hard to visualize it this way. Instead, it is then possible to see such an $n$-tuple as an ordered list of $n$ elements.\n",

    "### Functions\n",
    "In Mathematics, a function $f$ from $X \\rightarrow Y$ relates all elements $x \\in X$ to exactly one other element $y\\in Y$. Common terminology is to call $X$ the domain and $Y$ the codomain. As an example the function '$square$' can be defined as follows:\n",

    "We denote a composition (i.e. a combination) of two functions with $f\\circ g$ which can intuitively be thought of as $f$ after $g$. This composition is applied to an argument as follows: $(f\\circ g)(x)$ for some $x$ which is defined as $f(g(x))$. For example\n",

    "As seen in the book, this composition is applied to projections. Take for example $1.1$ with $f_i : Y \\rightarrow X_i$ which states:\n",

    "### Isomorphism\n",
    "The book shows the following equation: $\\mathcal{L}(0)\\cong 1$ which can be read as '$\\mathcal{L}(0)$ is *isomorphic* to $1$'. Formally, $X$ is isomorphic to $Y$ if there is a morphism (i.e. a function) $m$ for which there exists a morphism $m^{-1}$ such that $m \\circ m^{-1} = id = m^{-1} \\circ m$ [[1]](#[1]). Such a morphism $m$ is called a *bijective* morphism because it is both *one-to-one* and *surjective* (for a detailed description of these terms please refer to [[2]](#[2])).\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice an isomorphism is a transformation that preserves the structure. To further illustrate this point let's take a closer look at $\\mathcal{L}(0)\\cong 1$. For $\\mathcal{L}(0)$ to be isomorphic to $1$ we need to define an $m$ that is a bijective morphism from $\\mathcal{L}(0)$ to $1$. Let's first expand the definitions:\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "Both the domain and codomain of $m$ only contain a singular element '$()$' thus by mapping these to eachother we have created a bijective morphism. It is clear that $m^{-1}$ is a trivial definition, this will be skipped. Now, let's look at the more interesting example, $\\mathcal{L}(1)\\cong \\mathbb{N}$. As the book states any set $X$ containing only a single element is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{N}$, so, for the sake of conveniance we define $X =\\{a\\}$. Then, we can unfold the definitions as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*} \n",
    "\\mathbb{N} &:= \\{0,1,2,3,\\dotsb\\} \\\\\n",

    "&= \\{(),(a),(a,a),(a,a,a),\\dotsb\\}\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",

Observe that indeed $m \\circ m^{-1} = id = m^{-1} \\circ m$ and that $m$ is a bijective morphism. Thus we can conclude that $\\mathcal{L}(X)\\cong \\mathbb{N}$ for $X=\\{a\\}$ and also, $\\mathcal{L}(1)\\cong\\mathbb{N}$ since we can just replace $a$ for any other single element like for example $()$.\n",
