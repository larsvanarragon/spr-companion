# Structured Probabilistic Reasoning - Online Companion
This is the Online Companion to the book [Structured Probabilistic Reasoning](http://www.cs.ru.nl/B.Jacobs/PAPERS/ProbabilisticReasoning.pdf) by Bart Jacobs.

## Contents
1. [Collections and Channels]()

## Note
It is not possible yet to view the contents of the companion online on Github pages. The contents can be viewed by opening either the HTML file or Jupyter notebook file locally. However, the widgets in the HTML file will not work, so it is recommended to view it in Jupyter.

## Running notebook with tokes, on (ubuntu) linux
Start as usual:

> jupyter notebook

In another window, type:

> jupyter notebook list

This gives a local URL 

http://localhost:8888/?token=...

Opening that URL gives access (at least in Chromium).
